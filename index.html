It has come to a point where we have been forced to shut the "Clover" server down. Does this mean we will not return? No, but as of right now our only server available has been required to be decommissioned. This is not only an announcement for all users who may be inconvenienced by this event but also a dedication to this project. I, the owner of KathoolXYZ, have had a wonderful time working on this and sharing the return with not only my friends but the public. ALL of our services will return in the future but I must redirect my focuses onto school, I am one person, I can only do so much and spend so much on these FREE services. Thank you for your understanding.<i><br/></i></div><div class="gjs-divider" id="ina55"></div><div class="gjs-grid-row" id="i1sd5"><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="immf2"><div class="gjs-image-box" id="igpsh"></div></div><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="idyyx"><div class="gjs-image-box" id="iwxyj"></div></div><div class="gjs-grid-column" id="isnjt"><div class="gjs-image-box" id="ibj3i"></div></div></div><div id="ire4p">RIP "Clover" Server 2023 - 2023</div></body>
